			T3 is a real-time collaborative web application that allows
			two or more people to work on documents at the same time.
			Originally conceived for troubleshooting applications, T3 is
			a complete re-write that generalizes the concept to allow
			applications such as manuals, sales pipelines, presentations
			and many more.
			</p>
			<p>
			The the basic concepts of T3 are simple, Sections, Rooms and
			People.
			</p>
			<p>
			A section is the basic unit of a document. A section can have
			many sections underneath it to form a hierarchical document.
			Sections can have text bodies and/or images attached to them.
			Sibling sections are ordered, so you can step through them with
			arrow buttons. Re-ordering is by drag and drop.
			</p>
			<p>
			Rooms are basic chat rooms. Any number of people can be in
			a room which shows a list of members and if they are online.
			</p>
			<p>
			You also can navigate through the section hierarchy in a room,
			and any navigation you do will be shown to other people in the
			same room. Also, edits done to the section will be shown immediately
			to other room members.
